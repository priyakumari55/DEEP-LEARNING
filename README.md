DATA DESCRIPTION

The dataset is comprised of tab-separated files with phrases from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. The train/test split has been preserved for the purposes of benchmarking, but the sentences have been shuffled from their original order. Each Sentence has been parsed into many phrases by the Stanford parser. Each phrase has a PhraseId. Each sentence has a SentenceId. Phrases that are repeated (such as short/common words) are only included once in the data.

·       train.tsv contains the phrases and their associated sentiment labels.

·       test.tsv contains just phrases.

 The sentiment labels are:

 0 - negative

1 - somewhat negative

2 - neutral

3 - somewhat positive

4 – positive



With the advent of social networking and internet, it is very common for the people to share their reviews or feedback on the products they purchase or on the services they make use of or sharing their opinions on an event. These reviews could be useful for the others if analyzed properly. But analyzing the enormous textual information manually is impossible and automation is required. The objective of sentiment analysis is to determine whether the reviews or opinions given by the people give a positive sentiment or a negative sentiment. This has to be predicted based on the given textual information in the form of reviews or ratings. Earlier many ML models like linear regression ,Random forest, logistic regression and SVM based models are used for this task but the introduction of deep neural networks has displaced all the classical methods and achieved greater success for the problem of automatically generating sentiment analysis information from textual descriptions.

 

OBJECTIVE

The objective  is to analyze the reviews and predict the sentiment based on the reviews available using different ml models and then compare their accuracy.

 MODELS TO BE USED TO ACHIECVE OUR OBJECTIVE-:

1.LSTM
